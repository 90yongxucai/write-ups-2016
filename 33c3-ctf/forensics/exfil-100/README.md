# 33c3 CTF : exfil-100

**Category:** Forensics
**Points:** 100
**Solves:** 140
**Description:**

We hired somebody to gather intelligence on an enemy party. But apparently they managed to lose the secret document they extracted. They just [sent us this](exfil.tar.xz) and said we should be able to recover everything we need from it.

Can you help?
